Write a program for performing Insertion and Deletion in a Red Black Tree.

Given a series of numbers you have to insert the nodes in the given order. After insertion of all nodes perform Level order traversal with their colors.
0 - Black
1 - Red

After that numbers will be given to perform a delete operation on the tree. 
After each deletion again you have to show the contents of the tree by performing Level Order Traversal with their colors.

Input:
N: denoting number of nodes;
arr[N]: Nodes to be inserted;
M: No of nodes to be deleted
X: Nodes to be deleted

Output:
First line with Level Order Traversal after inserting N nodes.
Next M lines with Level Order Traversal after each deletion.
